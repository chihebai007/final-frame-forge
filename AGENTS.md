- Store fixed public-page photo settings as `image_` keys in `site_texts`, separate from text editing, so existing admin permissions and public reads remain authoritative.
- Validate public image sources through `public/image-url.js`, allowing raster data URLs from the shared admin picker but rejecting executable sources.
- Treat empty saved image values as intentionally removed across public and admin views; the shared picker separates the selected preview from the optional preset library to avoid confusing removal with asset deletion.
- Enforce shop-staff permissions with database role policies and admin-only team server functions; UI visibility is not authorization.
- Provision manager credentials through the admin-only team function, require explicit consent before replacing an existing account password, and never return or persist plaintext passwords; this keeps account control deliberate and credentials transient.
- Keep anonymous analytics in daily aggregate rows without IP addresses or persistent visitor identifiers; acquisition sources are recorded on orders for customer attribution.
- Enforce cancelled-only order deletion in a database trigger as well as the shared UI rule, so every deletion path respects the restriction.
- Store quantity offers on products and share pack-pricing logic between the storefront and order handler; persist the chosen pack label with order items so historical orders remain understandable.
- Checkout offer changes use shared pricing validation and update the persisted cart and totals together, preserving pack counts and checking aggregate product stock.
- Keep the pack editor scoped to its parent product and collapse secondary translation fields; this keeps the primary price and quantity controls unambiguous.

- Render fixed public photos only from saved `image_` settings, without HTML/CSS preset sources, so refreshes and failed reads cannot resurrect old or removed photos.
- Admin saves re-translate French content to EN/AR through the staff-only translateFields server function (site_texts/articles/awards store it in a translations jsonb; products use name_*/description_* and pack label_*/badge_*), and saving still succeeds if translation fails.
